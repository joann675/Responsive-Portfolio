      <p>I am a software developer who joined the bootcamp class to expand my knowledge of full stack
        development. I have always done backend development so I am sure I will find this class
        challenging and expect to learn many new skills. I know I will have to put in a lot of effort but
        it will be worth it. Upon graduating, I hope to apply my new found skills to my current position or to
        possibly find a position in another company.</p>

      <p>I have two grown children and am about to become a grandmother for the first time. I am looking forward to being able to spoil my new grandbaby.</p>

      <p>I also have two very large Rottweilers that think they are my children. They are alot of fun and, whenever I come home from work, they are the first to greet me at the door.</p>
      <p>Outside of work, my husband and I like to travel. We've been to many of the Caribbean islands and would like to explore Europe in the future. We are also "foodies" so visiting Italy, Ireland, France and Germany are high on our wish list.</p>
